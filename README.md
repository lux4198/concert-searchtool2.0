## About the Project 

This Webapp helps you find concerts for the major classical orchestras in Germany for the current concert season. You can search for a mix of composers, conductors, musicians, pieces etc. and filter your search by cities and date. 

## Built With 

This Project uses NextJs to statically generate the site. The Concert data was gathered by Web scraping with Python Library [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and the data is stored in a PostGreSQL Database on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). The Search function uses Fuzzysearch from [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/). 




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
